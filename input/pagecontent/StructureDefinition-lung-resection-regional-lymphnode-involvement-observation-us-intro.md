Lymph node metastases are an adverse prognostic factor, the extent of which is dependent on the location of the involved lymph nodes. The involved lymph node stations should be recorded according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) lymph node map. Given the nature of the procedure, lymph nodes obtained by mediastinoscopy are often received fragmented, and it may not be possible to distinguish a single fragmented lymph node from fragments of multiple lymph nodes. For this reason, only if the actual number of nodes is known or provided should it be quantified. Otherwise, it is permissible to report the sites of nodal metastases without specifying the number involved. 

Although extranodal extension of a positive mediastinal lymph node may represent an unfavorable prognostic finding, it does not change the pN classification or the TNM stage grouping. Extranodal extension refers to the extension of metastatic intranodal tumor beyond the lymph node capsule into the surrounding tissue. Direct extension of a primary tumor into a nearby lymph node does not qualify as extranodal extension. 

The anatomic classification of regional lymph nodes proposed by the IASLC is shown below. A complete description of the anatomic limits of each nodal station can be found in the AJCC Staging Manual.1 

Station 1 Lower cervical, supraclavicular, and sternal notch nodes
Station 2 Upper paratracheal nodes
Station 3  Prevascular and retrotracheal nodes 
Station 4  Lower paratracheal nodes: 
Station 5 Subaortic nodes (aorto-pulmonary window)
Station 6  Paraaortic nodes (ascending aorta or phrenic)
Station 7  Subcarinal nodes
Station 8  Paraesophageal nodes (below carina)
Station 9  Pulmonary ligament nodes
Station 10  Hilar nodes
Station 11  Interlobar nodes
Station 12  Lobar nodes
Station 13  Segmental nodes
Station 14  Subsegmental nodes

Metastasis to nonregional lymph nodes (ie, lymph nodes that are not included in the IASLC map) are assigned to the M1b or M1c category depending or whether single or multiple metastases are present.
