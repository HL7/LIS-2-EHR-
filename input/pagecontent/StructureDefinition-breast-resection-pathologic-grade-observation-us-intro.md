All invasive breast carcinomas should be graded.1 The Nottingham combined histologic grade (Elston-Ellis modification of Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grading system) should be used for reporting. Within each stage grouping there is a relation between histologic grade and outcome.

The Nottingham combined histologic grade evaluates the amount of tubule formation, the extent of nuclear pleomorphism, and the mitotic count (or mitotic rate). Each variable is given a score of 1, 2, or 3, and the scores are added to produce a grade. The mitotic score is determined by the number of mitotic figures found in 10 consecutive high-power fields (HPF) in the most mitotically active part of the tumor. Only clearly identifiable mitotic figures should be counted; hyperchromatic, karyorrhectic, or apoptotic nuclei are excluded. Because of variations in field size, the HPF size must be determined for each microscope and the appropriate point score determined accordingly. It is recommended that the size be measured by using a micrometer. However, the diameter of an HPF can also be calculated by using the method below.

Measuring the Size of a High-Power Field (HPF) With a Ruler
Use a clear ruler to measure the diameter of a low-power field. This number can be used to calculate a constant based on the following formula:

Eyepiece Magnification x Objective Magnification x Microscopic Field Diameter = A Constant
When the value of the constant is known, the diameter of an HPF can be calculated for other objectives by using the following formula:

Unknown Field Diameter = Constant / (Eyepiece Magnification x Objective Magnification)
Half of the field diameter is the radius of the field (r), which can then be used to calculate the area of the HPF:

3.1415 x r 2 = Area of Microscopic Field
If the microscopic field diameter or the area of the field is known, Table 1 can be used to determine the number of mitoses corresponding to different scores.

Score Categories According to Field Diameter and Mitotic Count
*Note- score counts below correspond to number of mitoses per 10 fields

| Field diameter (mm)  | Area (mm2)  | Score 1 | Score 2 | Score 3
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | 
| 0.40     | 0.125     | $\le$ 4    | 5 to 9  | $\ge$ 10 |
| 0.41     | 0.132     | $\le$ 4    | 5 to 9  | $\ge$ 10 |
| 0.42     | 0.139     | $\le$ 5    | 6 to 10  | $\ge$ 11 |
