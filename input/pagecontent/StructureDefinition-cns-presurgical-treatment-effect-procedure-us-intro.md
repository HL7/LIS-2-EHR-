In particular, prior radiation therapy or radiosurgery may alter the interpretation of specimens in which there are increased cellular atypia, decreased proliferative activity, or large areas of radiation-induced change (e.g., coagulative [nonpalisading] necrosis, vascular hyalinization, and gliosis). The addition of chemotherapy to radiation may further alter histomorphological appearance. For patients with malignant gliomas, the presence and degree of radiation necrosis appear to be of prognostic significance. Tumors that show evidence of radiation necrosis are associated with a longer survival, and the degree of necrosis appears to be prognostically significant. Corticosteroid treatment can alter the pathologic features of some CNS diseases. In particular, the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma with corticosteroids can be associated with widespread tumor necrosis or infiltration by macrophages, which may limit or misguide interpretation. Embolization of certain tumor types, especially meningiomas, may introduce histologic changes in the neoplasm.
