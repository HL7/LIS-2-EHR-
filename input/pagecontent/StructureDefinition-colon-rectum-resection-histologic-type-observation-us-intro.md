The histologic types of colorectal carcinoma that have been shown to have adverse prognostic significance independent of stage are signet-ring cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (large cell and small cell subtypes).

Medullary carcinoma is a distinctive histologic type strongly associated with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), indicative of defects in DNA repair gene function. Medullary carcinoma may occur either sporadically or in association with Lynch syndrome. This tumor type is characterized by solid growth in nested, organoid, or trabecular patterns, with no immunohistochemical evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation. Medullary carcinomas are also characterized by numerous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and a better prognosis.

Micropapillary carcinoma is characterized by small, tight clusters of tumor cells in cleft-like spaces and is often present in association with conventional adenocarcinoma. This variant is strongly associated with lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastasis.

Serrated adenocarcinomas are characterized by neoplastic glands showing prominent serrations, tumor cells with basal nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, and no or minimal luminal necrosis. These tumors are thought to be related to traditional serrated adenomas and may have a more aggressive course than conventional adenocarcinoma.
