Features pertaining to a specific cancer (ie, histologic type, grade, size, and the results of ER, PgR, and HER2 studies) should be provided for the largest invasive carcinoma in the case summary. If smaller carcinomas differ in histologic type or grade, this information should be included under “Additional Pathologic Findings,” and additional ancillary tests are recommended for these carcinomas. Features pertaining to all carcinomas (eg, margins, lymph node status) can be reported in the body of the case summary.
