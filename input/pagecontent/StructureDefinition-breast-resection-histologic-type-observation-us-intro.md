Note: Determination of histologic type is based on routine histologic examination; special stains such as e-cadherin are not required for determining histologic type. The histologic type corresponds to the largest carcinoma. If there are smaller carcinomas of a different type, this information should be included under “Additional Pathologic Findings.”
Note: Special type carcinomas should consist of at least 90% pure pattern.

This protocol applies to all invasive carcinomas of the breast. The World Health Organization (WHO)1 classification of breast carcinoma is recommended, although the protocol does not preclude the use of other classifications or histologic types. Carcinomas may be classified based on the H&E appearance without the use of immunohistochemical studies. 

A modified list is presented in the case summary based on the most frequent types of invasive carcinomas and terminology that is in widespread usage. The modified list is intended to capture the majority of tumors and reduce the frequency of tumors being reported as “other.” Choices are added for tumors with mixed features and those with some but not all features of specific histologic types.
