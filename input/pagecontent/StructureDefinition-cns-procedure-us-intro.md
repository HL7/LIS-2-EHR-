It is useful to know if the specimen was procured by open craniotomy or stereotactic biopsy. Since tumors may be heterogeneous, adequate sampling is an issue. The reliability of the prognostic information derived from such specimens may vary depending on how the specimen was obtained.

Specimen Handling, Triage, and Special Procedures
(While the reporting of specimen handling is not required in this protocol, the following information may be helpful.) It may be necessary to divide biopsy/resection tissue into portions for the following procedures:
● Squash/smear/touch preparations
● Frozen sections 
● Unfrozen, routine, permanent paraffin sections (essential to avoid artifacts of freezing tissue)
● Electron microscopy (retain a small portion in glutaraldehyde, or "embed and hold" for electron microscopy, if necessary)
● Frozen tissue, for possible molecular diagnostic studies (freeze fresh tissue as soon as possible and store)
● Other (microbiology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, molecular diagnostics)

Since cytologic details are essential for interpreting CNS neoplasms, previously frozen tissue with its inherent artifacts is suboptimal, especially for subclassifying and grading gliomas. Recommendations for optimal freezing and frozen sections from CNS tissue have been published.1 It is imperative to retain tissue that has not been previously frozen for permanent sections. Avoid using sponges in cassettes because they produce angular defects that resemble vascular/luminal spaces in the final sections. It is more appropriate to wrap small biopsies in lens paper or into tissue sacs prior to submitting in cassettes. If frozen and permanent sections are nondiagnostic, tissue that was retained in glutaraldehyde may be submitted for additional paraffin sections.

In touch, smear, and squash preparations, the presence of cells with long delicate processes is suggestive of a primary CNS cell type. The identification of macrophages is important since a macrophage-rich lesion is more likely a subacute infarct or demyelination, rather than a neoplasm.

If an infectious etiology is suspected, the neurosurgeon should be alerted to submit a fresh sample to microbiology to be processed for bacterial, fungal, and/or viral cultures.

If a lymphoproliferative disorder is suspected and sufficient tissue is available, a portion of fresh tissue should be set aside for appropriate workup.
