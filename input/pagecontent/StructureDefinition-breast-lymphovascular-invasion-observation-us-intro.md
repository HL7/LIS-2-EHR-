Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is associated with local recurrence and reduced survival. Distinguishing lymphatic channels from blood vessels is unnecessary. Documenting the presence of dermal lymphovascular invasion is particularly important because of its strong association with the clinical findings of inflammatory breast carcinoma. Reporting the LVI status for stage IIA and IIB patients who have an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may influence the use of radiotherapy. 

Strict criteria have been proposed for the diagnosis of LVI (See Criteria for LVI below). Lymphovascular invasion may be seen in stroma between uninvolved lobules and can sometimes be mistaken for DCIS if the cells completely fill the lymphatic space. 

Guidelines issued by the St. Gallen International Expert Consensus Conference6 include recommendations based on the presence of “extensive” LVI but do not define the term “extensive.” There are conflicting results on the significance of the number of foci of LVI.  Pathologists may report the number of foci or the number of blocks with LVI as a measure of extent.

Criteria for LVI:
1. LVI must be diagnosed outside the border of the invasive carcinoma. The most common area to find LVI is within 1 mm of the edge of the carcinoma
2. The tumor emboli usually do not conform exactly to the contours of the space in which they are found. In contrast, invasive carcinoma with retraction artifact mimicking LVI will have exactly the same shape
3. Endothelial cell nuclei should be seen in the cells lining the space
4. . Lymphatics are often found adjacent to blood vessels and often partially encircle a blood vessel
