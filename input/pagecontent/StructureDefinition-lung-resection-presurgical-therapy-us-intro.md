For patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgical resection, quantifying the extent of therapy-induced tumor regression provides prognostically relevant information.1 Measuring residual tumor size in patients with a partial response can be challenging, as there are often discontinuous clusters of viable tumor at the peripheral edges of an irregular area of treatment-related necrosis. The AJCC suggests multiplying the percentage of the mass that is composed of viable tumor by the size of the total mass to estimate postneoadjuvant tumor size.2,3 A “y” prefix is applied to the TNM classification in resections following multimodality therapy (see Note I). If no viable tumor is identified on resection, ypT0 is the appropriate designation.
