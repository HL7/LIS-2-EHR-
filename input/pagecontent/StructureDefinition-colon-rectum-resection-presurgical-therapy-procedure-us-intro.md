Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in rectal cancer is associated with significant tumor response and downstaging.1 Because eradication of the tumor, as detected by pathologic examination of the resected specimen, is associated with a significantly better prognosis,2 specimens from patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation should be thoroughly sectioned, with careful examination of the tumor site. Minimal residual disease has been shown to have a better prognosis than gross residual disease.3 A modified Ryan scheme is suggested for scoring of tumor response, and has been shown to provide good interobserver reproducibility provide prognostic significance.4 Several other systems have been studied and can be chosen to report the tumor regression score. 


Modified Ryan Scheme for Tumor Regression Score
| Description | Tumor Regression Score    | 
| -------- | -------- | 
|No viable cancer cells (complete response) |0| 
|Single cells or rare small groups of cancer cells (near complete response)|1|
|Residual cancer with evident tumor regression, but more than single cells or rare small groups of cancer cells (partial response) |2|
|Extensive residual cancer with no evident tumor regression (poor or no response)|3|

Tumor regression should be assessed only in the primary tumor; lymph node metastases should not be included in the assessment. 

Acellular pools of mucin in specimens following neoadjuvant therapy are considered to represent completely eradicated tumor and are not used to assign pT stage or counted as positive lymph nodes.
